# NASA-SpaceApp-Hackathon-Challenge_Integrated-assessment

## Challenge: An Integrated Assessment
> Our challenge was to integrate various Earth Observation-derived features with available socio-economic data in order to discover or enhance our understanding of COVID-19 impacts.

## Project Title: US County jobs Vulnerable to COVID-19
> By: Shivam Chauhan ,Dong Quoc Tuong , Rachelle Maranon.

## Summary

> Our team focuses on looking at the COVID-19 impacts in American Counties regarding the unemployment rate and poverty. We further looked into the counties in which job losses are more vulnerable to COVID-19.

## How We Addressed This Challenge

> Our challenge was to integrate socio-economic data like the unemployment data of each county with COVID-19 Vulnerability Index (CVI) which is a measurement of the negative impact that the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis can have on employment-based upon a region's mix of industries.

> Some questions we are looking to answer are:
>- Which county has a higher Labour Force?
>- Which county has a higher unemployment rate?
>- Which county has a higher COVID-19 Vulnerability Index (CVI)?
>- What is the correlation between the CVI and the Unemployment rate?
>- Which county has higher CVI among the top county with a higher unemployment rate?
>- What are the changes in Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) images of that area? 

## How We Developed This Project

> COVID-19 has impacted us in some sort of way, we have some team members from a different country and all of us are students, and some of us have lost our part-time jobs. So we decided to explore insights on how COVID-19 has impacted and on which jobs. Another motivation was to learn how to integrate the GIS/Earth Observation data so that we can work further to find solutions and insights. 

> We focused on the COVID-19 Vulnerability Index (CVI). An average Vulnerability Index score is 100, representing the average job loss expected in the United States. Higher scores indicate the degree to which job losses may be greater — an index score of 200, for example, means the rate of job loss can be twice as large as the national average. Conversely, an index score of 50 would mean a possible job loss of half the national average. Regions heavily dependent on tourism with relatively high concentrations of leisure and hospitality jobs, for example, are likely to have high index scores.

> The Vulnerability Index only measures the impact potential related to the mix of industry employment. The index does not take into account variation due to a region’s rate of virus infection, nor does it factor in local government's policies in reaction to the virus.

> We found tried to found out which is the most impacted county and looked to its Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) images. 

> This is an example of how we can integrate Earth Observation data after finding the location of the most vulnerable place and look at the satellite images for the changes. 

> The tools we used for this project are Python, Tableau, and QGIS.
