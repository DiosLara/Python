    "Data Description: Using the above data sets there can be plethora of information that can be inferred and jotted down to draw conclusions. Hence, data sets are generally referred to a collection of information. For example, Earth Observation data set provides us valuable information regarding condition of major food corps across the globe to assess production aspects. Earth Observation data majorly depends on indices like Agricultural Stress Index, Rain fall Estimates data, Progress of Season, Mean Vegetation Health index . These indices are termed as datum. Such information will lead us to identify agricultural areas that will be affected by dry spells or droughts in extreme cases. This will in turn help us to evaluate sustainable methods to avoid such extreme situations. These data sets include a wide variety collection of information on various aspects that effect the soil fertility. They are represented in the form of world maps with seasonal indicators that allow us to identify areas of croplands and grasslands with higher or lower likelihood of water stress.\n",
